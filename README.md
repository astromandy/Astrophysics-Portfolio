# 🪐 Astrophysics Portfolio: Cataclysmic Variables

Welcome! I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics focused on the characterization and classification of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) through light curve and spectroscopic analysis.

## 🌌 Projects

- **[VSX CVs Scraper](./vsx_cvs_scraper/)**: Selenium script to automatically download CV lists from AAVSO’s VSX database.
- **[ASAS-SN Light Curves](./lightcurve_fetcher/)**: Python script to retrieve public light curves using ASAS-SN data.
- **[CV Classification](./classification_model/)**: Machine learning models to classify cataclysmic variable stars based on public time series data.

## 🔭 Areas of Interest

- Time-domain astronomy  
- Spectral line analysis  
- Variable star classification using machine learning
